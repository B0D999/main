Oh well, honor for all
Of the big and the small
Well the taller they stand
Well the harder they fall
We live for today
But we die for the next
With blood in our veins
And the air in our chest
So we step into war
With our hearts on the line
Dirt on our boots
It shakes free over time
The music it fades
The violin slows
The darkness it rises
As the sun goes
